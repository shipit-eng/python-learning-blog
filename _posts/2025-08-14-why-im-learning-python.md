Hello, world! I'm Kristine, and this marks the (re)start of my Python learning journey. üêç

After a long break, I'm back and more excited than ever to explore the world of programming. I've always been fascinated by how software works, and Python stood out to me as a beginner-friendly yet incredibly powerful language.

Through this blog, I‚Äôll be sharing everything I learn-- from basic syntax and data structures to building real-world projects. Expect tutorials, code snippets, reflections, and maybe even a few fun bugs I encounter along the way.

Thanks for joining me on this adventure. Stay tuned for more posts as I dive deeper into Python and discover what I can create!
